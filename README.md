# Pickmu â€” Mobile Frontend

**Role:** Mobile Frontend Developer  
**Tech Stack:** React Native, Expo, EAS, React Navigation, Context API/Redux, Geolocation APIs, Real-time Chat

## Project Overview
Pickmu is a delivery mobile app connecting individuals and businesses with nearby riders. Users can request services, track orders in real time, manage profiles and wallets, upload documents, and communicate directly with riders.  

I developed the **complete mobile frontend**, including all user and rider interfaces, adaptive screens, and integration with APIs and device features such as geolocation, push notifications, and real-time updates using Webhooks.

## Challenges and Solutions
During development, I faced several challenges:  

1. **Integrating geolocation and real-time tracking:** Ensuring accurate location updates and map rendering on both Android and iOS required optimizing state management and handling permission issues.  
2. **Adaptive UI for multiple screen sizes:** Some components did not scale correctly on smaller devices. Solved by using responsive layouts and dynamic styling.  
3. **Authentication across multiple providers:** Implementing Google, Apple, and email login in a single flow was complex. Used proper libraries and context-based state management to unify authentication logic.  
4. **Real-time chat integration with Webhooks:** Ensuring messages sync correctly between users and riders required careful handling of API calls, state updates, and webhook events.  
5. **Document uploads and validations:** Handling large files and validation errors without crashing the app involved testing multiple edge cases and asynchronous flows.  
6. **Push notifications via EAS:** Ensuring notifications were delivered correctly for order updates and chat required proper integration and testing across platforms.  

Thanks to **Fernando (backend developer)** for providing support with API endpoints, debugging, Webhooks, and backend integration, which made development much smoother.
